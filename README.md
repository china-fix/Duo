# Duo
A biological signature based method to batch analyze functional similarities of proteins
# Introduction
Duo is a workflow to batch analyze functional similarities of proteins. A key utility provided by Duo is to screen for query proteins with specific characteristics based on highly free and customizable reference protein sequences inputted by users.
# Dependencies
1. [python 3.6.9](https://www.python.org/) and following librarires are required:
* [Biopython 1.74](https://biopython.org/)
* [pandas 1.1.3](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [InterProScan 5 (version 5.47-82.0)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/download/);
3. [hmmer 3.3](http://hmmer.org/download.html);
4. [ps_scan 20.0](https://prosite.expasy.org/prosite.html)
